# Nest Protect integration for Home Assistant

Custom component for Home Assistant to interact with Nest Protect devices via an undocumented and unofficial Nest API. Unfortunately, Google SDM doesn't support Nest Protect devices and thus the core [Nest integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nest/) won't work for Nest Protect.

This integration will add the most important sensors of your Nest Protect device (CO, heat and smoke) and the occupancy if your device is wired (to main power). In addition, it will expose several diagnostic and configuration entities. All sensor values will be updated real-time.

## Known limitations

- Only Google Accounts are supported, there is no plan to support legacy Nest accounts
- When Nest Protect (wired) occupancy is triggered, it will stay 'on' for 10 minutes. (API limitation)
- Authentication relies on the Google OAuth consent screen. Make sure pop-ups are allowed when linking the integration in Home Assistant.

## Installation

You can install this integration via [HACS](#hacs) or [manually](#manual).

### HACS

Search for the Nest Protect integration and choose install, then reboot Home Assistant. Configure the Nest Protect integration either via the integrations page or press the blue button below.


[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=nest_protect)

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/nest_protect` to your custom_components folder and reboot Home Assistant. Configure the Nest Protect integration either via the integrations page or press the blue button below.

## Authentication

The Nest Protect integration now uses Google's OAuth flow. When you set up the integration in Home Assistant, you will be redirected to Google to approve access for the selected environment (standard production or field test). Once authorized, Home Assistant securely stores the issued access and refresh tokens and refreshes them automatically as needed. If Google revokes the authorization or you revoke it manually, Home Assistant will prompt you to reauthenticate.

## Advanced

Feel free to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/iMicknl/ha-nest-protect/issues/new/choose) if you find an issue or if you have a suggestion. It is always helpful to download the diagnostics information and to include debug logging.

### Enable debug logging

The [logger](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logger/) integration lets you define the level of logging activities in Home Assistant. Turning on debug mode will show more information about unsupported devices in your logbook.

```
logger:
  default: critical
  logs:
    custom_components.nest_protect: debug
```
